# Plant Tissue Segmentation with Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and analysis used in our study:  
**"Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks to Draft a Blueprint of Plant Tissues."**

We compare manual tracing with **Ilastik's** trace on plant microscopy images to evaluate accuracy, speed, and scalability for cell boundary detection and morphological analysis.

##Methods

- **Manual Tracing**: Used as the gold standard for evaluating segmentation accuracy  
- **Ilastik**: Pixel classification based on user-labeled regions  
- **Skeletonization**: Used for vector representation and post-processing analysis

## Metrics

We assessed performance using:
- Dice coefficient
- Over/under segmentation heatmaps
- Cell count accuracy
- Cell size distribution comparison
