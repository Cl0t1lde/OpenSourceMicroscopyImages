# Plant Tissue Segmentation with Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and analysis used in our study:  
**"Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks to Draft a Blueprint of Plant Tissues."**

We compare manual tracing with **Ilastik's** trace on plant microscopy images to evaluate accuracy, speed, and scalability for cell boundary detection and morphological analysis.

## Methods

- **Manual Tracing**: Used as the gold standard for evaluating segmentation accuracy  
- **Ilastik**: Pixel classification based on user-labeled regions  
- **Skeletonization**: Used for vector representation and post-processing analysis

## Metrics

We assessed performance using:
- Dice coefficient
- Over/under segmentation heatmaps
- Cell count accuracy
- Cell size distribution comparison

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Cl0t1lde/OpenSourceMicroscopyImages.git
cd OpenSourceMicroscopyImages

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main analysis pipeline:
python manual_images.py

5. To run any other script:
python script_name.py (replace script_name with the desired filename)

## Results

Executing the analysis pipeline generates detailed visualizations and quantitative summaries that compare manual and automated segmentation methods, providing insights into accuracy, error types, and morphological features of plant tissues.
